# üß© Inheritance vs Composition

---

## üîç Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit functionality from a parent class.  
It supports **code reuse** through a hierarchical relationship.

### ‚úÖ When to use:

- There's a strong **"is-a"** relationship.
- You want to extend or override base class behavior.
- Example: `AppCompatActivity` extends `Activity`.

---

## üîß Composition

Composition allows a class to **include other objects** and use their functionality.  
It promotes **modularity** and **loose coupling**.

### ‚úÖ When to use:

- You want more flexibility and testability.
- You‚Äôre combining multiple responsibilities or behaviors.
- Example: A `ViewModel` with injected `UseCase` classes.

## ‚öñÔ∏è In Android Development

Use **inheritance** sparingly. Overusing it can create tight, fragile class hierarchies.  
Prefer **composition** when building scalable and testable components (e.g., in Clean Architecture).
