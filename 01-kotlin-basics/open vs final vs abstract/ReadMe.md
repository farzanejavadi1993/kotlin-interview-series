### ðŸ’¡ Question
What is the difference between `open`, `final`, and `abstract` in Kotlin?

### âœ… Answer
These keywords define how a class or member behaves in terms of inheritance:

- `open` allows a class or method to be extended or overridden.
- `final` (default in Kotlin) prevents a class or method from being extended or overridden.
- `abstract` is used in abstract classes â€” it forces subclasses to implement the method or property.

ðŸŸ¢ `open` is used when you **intentionally** want a method to be overridden.
ðŸ”´ `final` is the default â€” it adds safety by preventing unwanted inheritance.
ðŸŸ£ `abstract` is used in base classes when some methods shouldnâ€™t have an implementation.
