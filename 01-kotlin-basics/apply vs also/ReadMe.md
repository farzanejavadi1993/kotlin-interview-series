### ðŸ’¡ Question
In which scenarios would you choose `apply` over `also`?

### âœ… Answer
Both `apply` and `also` are used for side-effect operations, but the difference is **how they refer to the object** and **what they return**.

- `apply` uses `this` and returns the object itself.
- `also` uses `it` and also returns the object.

ðŸŸ¡ Use `apply` when you're configuring an object â€” setting multiple properties on it.

ðŸŸ¡ Use `also` when you're performing side-effects (like logging or tracking), but don't need to access the object's members directly.
