# How do extension functions work and when should you use them?

## âœ… Summary
Extension functions in Kotlin let you add new functions to existing classes without modifying their source code.  
They're a powerful tool for writing cleaner, more readable, and reusable code.

## ðŸ“˜ Detailed Explanation

- Declared using the syntax: `fun ReceiverType.functionName() { ... }`
- Internally, they are **static functions** with the receiver object passed as an argument.
- They don't actually modify the class; just make it feel like they do.

## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases
- Avoid utility classes like `StringUtils`, `MathHelper`, etc.
- Make code more expressive (e.g., `user.isAdult()` instead of `UserUtils.isAdult(user)`)
- Add functionality to classes you don't own (like Android SDK classes or third-party libraries)

## ðŸ’» Example

```kotlin
fun String.removeWhitespace(): String {
    return this.replace(" ", "")
}

val raw = "Kotlin is awesome"
val cleaned = raw.removeWhitespace()
println(cleaned) // Kotlinisawesome
